class SubGraphView(object):
  """A subgraph view on an existing `tf.Graph`.

  An instance of this class is a subgraph view on an existing `tf.Graph`.
  "subgraph" means that it can represent part of the whole `tf.Graph`.
  "view" means that it only provides a passive observation and do not to act
  on the `tf.Graph`. Note that in this documentation, the term "subgraph" is
  often used as substitute to "subgraph view".

  A subgraph contains:

  * a list of input tensors, accessible via the `inputs` property.
  * a list of output tensors, accessible via the `outputs` property.
  * and the operations in between, accessible via the "ops" property.

  An subgraph can be seen as a function F(i0, i1, ...) -> o0, o1, ... It is a
  function which takes as input some input tensors and returns as output some
  output tensors. The computation that the function performs is encoded in the
  operations of the subgraph.

  The tensors (input or output) can be of two kinds:

  - connected: a connected tensor connects to at least one operation contained
  in the subgraph. One example is a subgraph representing a single operation
  and its inputs and outputs: all the input and output tensors of the op
  are "connected".
  - passthrough: a passthrough tensor does not connect to any operation
  contained in the subgraph. One example is a subgraph representing a
  single tensor: this tensor is passthrough. By default a passthrough tensor is
  present both in the input and output tensors of the subgraph. It can however
  be remapped to only appear as an input (or output) only.

  The input and output tensors can be remapped. For instance, some input tensor
  can be omitted. For instance, a subgraph representing an operation with two
  inputs can be remapped to only take one input. Note that this does not change
  at all the underlying `tf.Graph` (remember, it is a view). It means that
  the other input is being ignored, or is being treated as "given".
  The analogy with functions can be extended like this: F(x,y) is the original
  function. Remapping the inputs from [x, y] to just [x] means that the subgraph
  now represent the function F_y(x) (y is "given").

  The output tensors can also be remapped. For instance, some output tensor can
  be omitted. Other output tensor can be duplicated as well. As mentioned
  before, this does not change at all the underlying `tf.Graph`.
  The analogy with functions can be extended like this: F(...)->x,y is the
  original function. Remapping the outputs from [x, y] to just [y,y] means that
  the subgraph now represent the function M(F(...)) where M is the function
  M(a,b)->b,b.

  It is useful to describe three other kind of tensors:

  * internal: an internal tensor is a tensor connecting operations contained
    in the subgraph. One example in the subgraph representing the two
    operations A and B connected sequentially: -> A -> B ->. The middle arrow
    is an internal tensor.
  * actual input: an input tensor of the subgraph, regardless of whether it is
    listed in "inputs" or not (masked-out).
  * actual output: an output tensor of the subgraph, regardless of whether it is
    listed in "outputs" or not (masked-out).
  * hidden input: an actual input which has been masked-out using an
    input remapping. In other word, a hidden input is a non-internal tensor
    not listed as a input tensor and one of whose consumers belongs to
    the subgraph.
  * hidden output: a actual output which has been masked-out using an output
    remapping. In other word, a hidden output is a non-internal tensor
    not listed as an output and one of whose generating operations belongs to
    the subgraph.

  Here are some useful guarantees about an instance of a SubGraphView:

  * the input (or output) tensors are not internal.
  * the input (or output) tensors are either "connected" or "passthrough".
  * the passthrough tensors are not connected to any of the operation of
  the subgraph.

  Note that there is no guarantee that an operation in a subgraph contributes
  at all to its inputs or outputs. For instance, remapping both the inputs and
  outputs to empty lists will produce a subgraph which still contains all the
  original operations. However, the remove_unused_ops function can be used to
  make a new subgraph view whose operations are connected to at least one of
  the input or output tensors.

  An instance of this class is meant to be a lightweight object which is not
  modified in-place by the user. Rather, the user can create new modified
  instances of a given subgraph. In that sense, the class SubGraphView is meant
  to be used like an immutable python object.

  A common problem when using views is that they can get out-of-sync with the
  data they observe (in this case, a `tf.Graph`). This is up to the user to
  ensure that this doesn't happen. To keep on the safe side, it is recommended
  that the life time of subgraph views are kept very short. One way to achieve
  this is to use subgraphs within a "with make_sgv(...) as sgv:" Python context.

  To alleviate the out-of-sync problem, some functions are granted the right to
  modified subgraph in place. This is typically the case of graph manipulation
  functions which, given some subgraphs as arguments, can modify the underlying
  `tf.Graph`. Since this modification is likely to render the subgraph view
  invalid, those functions can modify the argument in place to reflect the
  change. For instance, calling the function swap_inputs(svg0, svg1) will modify
  svg0 and svg1 in place to reflect the fact that their inputs have now being
  swapped.
